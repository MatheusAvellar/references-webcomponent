# References Web Component

Experiment on Web Components to figure out how they work!

Demo: https://lab.avl.la/references-webcomponent/

This repo contains two Web Components:

* `<cite-web>` for inline citations;
* `<references-list>` at the bottom to generate the list.

## Issues

* Barely works without JavaScript; when [:has](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)
finally drops, and with a better support for [attr()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr()),
that might change
