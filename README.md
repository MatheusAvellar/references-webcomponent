# References Web Component

Experiment on Web Components to figure out how they work!

Demo: https://lab.avl.la/references-webcomponent/

This repo contains two Web Components:

* `<cite-web>` for inline citations;
* `<references-list>` at the bottom to generate the list.

## Issues

* Won't work at all without JavaScript ðŸ¥´ I'll look into fallbacks, if it's even possible
